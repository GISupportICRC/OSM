###Mapathon: The Bambari water project, Central African Republic.

Our Wathab colleagues are implementing various projects in the cities of Bambari, Dékoué and Kaga-Bandoro, (CAR).  Among these cities, Bambari was quickly mapped during the events last year but about 60% of the buildings and roads are still missing (cf map below).

Some water infrastructure data about well and network have already been mapped by the ICRC team and its partners in Bamabari.

Combining the maps on water availability and population density will allow our colleagues to improve the water supply.

####The Task:
